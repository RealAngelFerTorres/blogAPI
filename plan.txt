TO DO:
Controllers
   * commentController: chequear eso de actualizar cuando se hace un edit para que tome el cambio
   * Later when doing the front: check for best aproach when receiving a response between
     editing and creating a post (is better a json or a error page?)
   * userController
      * Check for authentication (token) when trying to create a post (only admin should)
